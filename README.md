Sub-themes are just like any other theme, with one difference: They inherit the parent theme's resources. There are no limits on the chaining capabilities connecting sub-themes to their parents. A sub-theme can be a child of another sub-theme, and it can be branched and organized however you see fit. This is what gives sub-themes great potential.

The script "subtheme-creator" that created the base files and folders for your new sub-theme did a lot of the mundane work in creating this new sub-theme.

Creating a sub-theme

A sub-theme must have a different internal name (i.e., the name used by Drupal) from its parent theme. This name must not contain any spaces or other special characters. The name of your sub-theme must start with an alphabetic character and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers and underscores. Let's suppose this sub-theme internal name is "my_subtheme".
